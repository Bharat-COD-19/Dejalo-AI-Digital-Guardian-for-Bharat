# Dejalo-AI-Digital-Guardian-for-Bharat
Dejalo AI is a rural-first digital guardian that monitors voice biomarkers and heart rate variability (HRV) to detect early signs of psychiatric distress. It provides real-time guidance, family alerts, and digital twin simulations to prevent crises before they occur.

# Dialo (Déjalo)
## Wearable-First AI Digital Guardian for Mental Health

> Preventing emotional crises before they happen.

Dialo is a wearable-first, multimodal AI system designed to detect emotional stress escalation in real time, predict crisis risk, and intelligently intervene before breakdown occurs.

It combines biometric sensing, edge AI, cloud-based multimodal modeling, and a personalized behavioral digital twin to create a preventive mental health protection system — especially for rural and underserved communities.

## 🚨 Problem

Psychiatric and emotionally vulnerable individuals often face:

- Sudden emotional escalation during conversations
- Family misunderstandings leading to conflict
- No continuous monitoring between doctor visits
- High stigma in rural environments
- Reactive intervention after damage occurs

Existing solutions are either:
- Chat-based (reactive)
- Screening-only (non-continuous)
- Fitness-focused wearables
- Isolated mental health apps

There is no unified system that continuously monitors, predicts, and mediates emotional crises in real time.

## 💡 Solution

Dialo introduces a wearable-first AI guardian that:

- Monitors voice biomarkers, HRV, and motion signals
- Detects stress escalation in <2 seconds
- Learns personalized triggers
- Builds a behavioral digital twin
- Predicts escalation risk
- Sends intelligent interventions to patient, family, and doctors
- Works offline-first for rural deployment

This shifts mental healthcare from reactive treatment to preventive protection.
